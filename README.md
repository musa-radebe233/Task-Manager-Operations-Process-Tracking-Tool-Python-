# Task-Manager-Operations-Process-Tracking-Tool-Python-
## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based task tracking and reporting system built to support day-to-day operational workflows in a small business or operations team. The application focuses on task allocation, monitoring, completion tracking, and performance reporting, all of which are core responsibilities in junior analyst and operations roles.

The system simulates real-world operational processes such as workload distribution, SLA monitoring, overdue task identification, and management reporting using structured data stored in text files.
